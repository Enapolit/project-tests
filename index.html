      <div class="text">Immigration to Bay Ridge, Fort Hamilton and Dyker Heights (CD 10) is booming. In 2019, there were an estimated 121,925 people living in Bay Ridge/Dyker Heights, 52% of whom were foreign-born residents. And, according to data from American Community Surveys, 17% of those foreign-born residents live in “extremely crowded housing." </div>

      <div class="text">There is an ongoing affordable housing crisis in CD 10 Brooklyn and NYC as a whole. From 2010 to 2020, Brooklyn added 78,300 housing units while the population grew by 230,000, according to the 2020 New York City census.The shortage of safe, legal housing options across CD 10 forces families to turn to illegal housing arrangements.

      <div class="text">Landlords have converted single-family homes to illegal multi-family units as demand for housing in ethnic enclaves in Bay Ridge, Fort Hamilton and Dyker Heights continues to rise. These illegally converted units attract more families than each neighborhood's school district can support.
The Department of Education, which uses data from the departments of health, housing, city planning, and buildings to project how many seats are needed to serve each district, often underestimates the needs of each community school district because landlords inaccurately report who is living in their buildings to avoid being apprehended by law enforcement.

      <div class="text">New York City has housing laws to combat illegal housing conversions. Under the Aggravated Illegal Conversions Law, or Local Law 94, law enforcement can impose $15,000 fines per unit on landlords who engage in illegal home conversions.These laws, however, are unenforceable because police officers have difficulty obtaining permits to enter illegally converted homes and prove that they exist, Sen. Andrew Gounardes says.</div>
